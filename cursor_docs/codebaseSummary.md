# Codebase Summary - Caren's Cookbook

## Project Overview
Caren's Cookbook is a Next.js 14 application that allows users to extract recipe information from URLs or photos using AI, then organize and browse their recipe collection by categories.

## Key Components and Their Interactions

### Recipe Import System
**Primary Components:**
- `RecipeImportModal.tsx` - Main modal with tabbed interface (URL/Photo)
- `EnhancedPhotoUpload.tsx` - Complex photo upload component with single/multiple modes
- `QuickActionsSection.tsx` - Entry point cards for import actions

**Critical UX Issue:** The current modal uses a confusing tabbed interface that overwhelms users with choices.

### State Management
- `useHomePage.ts` - Central hook managing all home page state and logic
- `useImageProcessing.ts` - Handles single image processing with retry logic
- `useMultipleImageProcessing.ts` - Manages multiple image processing

### API Layer
- `/api/scan-recipe/` - Single image processing endpoint
- `/api/scan-recipe-multiple/` - Multiple image processing endpoint
- `/api/fetch-recipe/` - URL-based recipe extraction
- `/api/fetch-recipe-stream/` - Streaming recipe extraction
- AI provider abstraction allows switching between OpenAI and Gemini

### **Database Layer (Prisma + PostgreSQL)**
- **User Model**: Clerk integration with rich onboarding and preferences
- **Recipe Model**: Stores extracted recipes with AI categorization metadata  
- **RecipeImage Model**: Multiple images per recipe with ordering
- **Analytics Models**: Comprehensive extraction performance tracking
  - **RecipeExtractionMetrics**: Individual extraction attempt tracking
  - **DomainPerformanceMetrics**: Aggregated domain performance data
  - **AIProviderCosts**: Cost tracking for different AI providers
- **Supporting Models**: Favorites, onboarding progress tracking

### **AI Recipe Extraction System** 
- **Primary APIs**: `/api/fetch-recipe` (standard) and `/api/fetch-recipe-stream` (streaming)
- **AI Providers**: OpenAI and Gemini with fallback strategies
- **Extraction Orchestrator**: Optimized URL-direct + HTML fallback strategies
- **Analytics Integration**: Comprehensive performance and quality tracking

### **Analytics & Performance Monitoring**
- **Real-time Metrics**: Stage-by-stage timing, AI provider performance, quality scores
- **Cost Tracking**: Automatic cost calculation and provider comparison
- **Domain Analysis**: Website-specific performance optimization
- **Quality Scoring**: Recipe completeness and extraction accuracy metrics
- **Analytics API**: `/api/analytics/extraction-metrics` for data retrieval

### **Category Management**
- AI-powered categorization with confidence scoring
- User-customizable categories during onboarding
- Category source tracking (AI vs user-generated)

### **User Experience**
- Comprehensive onboarding flow with step tracking
- Real-time recipe import with progress indicators
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Data Flow

### Recipe Import Flow (Current - Problematic)
1. User clicks "Import from URL" or "Scan Recipe" in QuickActionsSection
2. `handleQuickImportURL()` or `handleQuickScanPhoto()` sets tab and opens modal
3. User faces confusing tabbed interface with multiple options
4. Complex decision tree: Tab → AI Provider → Upload Mode → File Selection
5. Processing happens through specialized hooks with progress tracking
6. Success redirects to recipe view, updates categories and recipe list

### **Recipe Extraction Flow (Enhanced)**
1. **User Input**: URL submission via frontend
2. **Analytics Setup**: Initialize timing and metrics tracking
3. **Strategy Selection**: Auto-detect optimal extraction method
4. **HTML Fetch**: Download and measure webpage content
5. **AI Processing**: Extract recipe data with provider-specific optimizations
6. **Validation**: Parse and validate extracted data with error tracking
7. **Database Save**: Store recipe and measure save performance
8. **Analytics Logging**: Complete metrics tracking and domain aggregation
9. **Response**: Return recipe with performance metadata

### **Analytics Data Flow**
1. **Real-time Collection**: Every extraction tracked with comprehensive metrics
2. **Quality Analysis**: Missing fields detection and completeness scoring
3. **Cost Calculation**: Real-time provider cost estimation
4. **Domain Aggregation**: Async performance summary updates
5. **API Access**: Analytics data available via REST endpoints

### Data Processing Pipeline
```
User Input → AI Processing → Recipe Extraction → Database Storage → UI Update
```

1. User submits recipe URL
2. System detects optimal AI extraction strategy  
3. AI processes HTML/URL and returns structured recipe data
4. **NEW**: Forgiving validation handles AI inconsistencies (null arrays)
5. Recipe categorized and stored with metadata
6. User can view, organize, and favorite recipes

## Recent Significant Changes

### User Feedback Integration Impact
**Critical Discovery:** Test users are confused by the current recipe import UX:

1. **Modal Complexity**: The tabbed interface (URL vs Photo) creates decision paralysis
2. **Information Overload**: Too many technical choices exposed upfront
3. **Poor Mobile Experience**: Complex modal doesn't work well on smaller screens
4. **Unclear Value Proposition**: Users don't understand when to use which option

### Technical Debt Identified
1. **Over-Engineering**: Current modal tries to handle too many scenarios in one interface
2. **Poor Separation of Concerns**: Upload modes and AI providers mixed together
3. **Mobile-Last Design**: Interface designed for desktop, then squeezed onto mobile

### **Validation Schema Fix (Latest)**
- **Problem**: AI sometimes returned `null` for `steps`/`ingredients` arrays, causing Zod validation errors
- **Solution**: Updated `RecipeSchema` in `/api/fetch-recipe/route.ts` to use `z.union([z.array(z.string()), z.null()])` with proper transformations
- **Impact**: Recipe imports now handle AI inconsistencies gracefully, preventing 500 errors during extraction
- **Implementation**: Added double safety checks in transform function to ensure arrays are never undefined/null

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Added comprehensive database indexes for category queries
- Implemented recipe extraction orchestrator with fallback strategies
- Full-text search indexes for future search functionality

### **Enhanced Onboarding System**
- Detailed step-by-step progress tracking
- User preference collection and storage
- Category customization during setup
