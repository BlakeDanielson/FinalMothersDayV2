Scrape melted butter and any brown bits to a large heatproof mixing bowl and let cool 1 minute. Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) unsalted butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).",

Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in 6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70% cacao), coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips (the cookie dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).",

Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets."
